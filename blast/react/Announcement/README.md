Announcement Component
======================

This is set of React components designed to deliver announcements to hotel employees when they logged in to the Blast system.  These announcements contained relevant information about brand standards, weekend events, or just messages from management.

The components display an arbitrary block of HTML, and allow the user to upvote, downvote, and dismiss the announcement.  They also register the user's actions with the server to allow for improved data analysis.

These were used in production with the Blast product.
